==========

just my own blog website.

- Use **django1.5 class based view** and **html5 with responsive web design**..

- overwrite django admin with **grappelli**, to show a administration interface. (it's important for me :) )

- use **django ckeditor** to Provides a RichTextField and CKEditorWidget.
Also utilizing CKEditor with image upload and browsing support included.

- use **south** to sync the database.

it's just a demo for new django begginer.
